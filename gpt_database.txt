You can go back to the referral view in Django by using the reverse() function. This function takes a view name, and optionally some positional and keyword arguments, and returns a URL that will point to that view. For example, if you have a view named 'referral_view', you can use the following code to go back to it:

url = reverse('referral_view')

You can also pass arguments to the view, like so:

url = reverse('referral_view', args=(arg1, arg2))

or

url = reverse('referral_view', kwargs={'key1': val1, 'key2': val2})

Once you have the URL, you can use the Django redirect() function to redirect the user to the view.
